# zeehaven

a tiny tool to convert [zeeschuimer](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/zeeschuimer) ndjson files into csv format.

web interface available at: https://publicdatalab.github.io/zeehaven/

if ndjson file is collected from instagram or twitter the tool structures the csv file accordingly, otherwise it outputs the whole ndjson file as a csv (which may contain many columns).

if you encounter problems you can [add an issue](https://github.com/PublicDataLab/zeehaven/issues).
